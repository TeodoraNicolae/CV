            <p><strong>1st semester:</strong> application for healthy eating*</p>
            <p>The idea was to create an application (with a gamified experience) so that it's easier to stick to healthy eating. <br> This application was realized only as a concept, a big part of which I was responsible for.</p>

            <p><strong>3rd semester:</strong> jump and run game*</p>
            <p>In a course called <em>Software Engineering</em> as a team we had to develop a game with basic features.</p>
            <p>I have programmed the shot of the player,  the graphical representation and animations of the game objects and the menu.</p>

             <p>* I want to note that these projects were made in a team and each one of us had different tasks to do, so I don't take full credit for the outcome.</p>
