    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="middle">
        <p>I am 26 years old, originally from Romania, but I have been living in Germany for the past 10 years. I discovered my passion for web design at a young age. My parents needed to create a website for their work, and I happened to assist them. It was at that moment when I realized that I would like to pursue something similar in the future. My passion for web design was further solidified during my internship. Therefore, I am eager to meet new people, explore fresh opportunities, and embark on a career as a Frontend Developer.</p>

        <p class="nospace">In my fifth semester of University, during my internship, I had the opportunity to work as a 
            <strong>Frontend Developer</strong>. This role primarily involved the maintenance and continuous development 
            of existing code, alongside the creation of new templates and the implementation of additional frontend functionality in <strong>Liferay</strong> projects using

        <strong class="time">01/2022 - 02/2023</strong> 
        <p class="nospace">Continuing my journey with the same company, I worked as a <strong>Werkstudentin</strong> in the same department. 
            My focus remained on maintaining and continuously developing existing code in <strong>Liferay</strong> projects using 
            <strong>Java, Freemarker, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. In this role I implemented tracking events, I developed new templates,
             and introduced additional frontend functionality. 
            Additionally, I successfully created an automated email sending and distribution contact form 
            utilizing <strong>JSP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</strong>. Furthermore, I created test cases for manual testing
             using tools such as <strong>Jira and X-Ray</strong>.</p>

            <h4><strong>8th semester:</strong> Bachelor Thesis</h4>
            <p>In my Bachelor's Thesis, I compare three JavaScript frontend frameworks: React, Svelte, and Ember. 
                Initially, I analyze and explain the important features of each framework in detail. Subsequently, 
                I conduct a performance comparison through various components (header, footer, people list, table, 
                photo gallery, contact form, animation) and tests that I created. Scalability is assessed using a 
                benchmark obtained from the internet. Finally, I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these 
                frameworks, deriving recommendations for their usage.</p>

        <div class="middle">
            <p>The header is designed with a logo and a navigation section, featuring links to each component.</p>
